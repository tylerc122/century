I want a minimal app,I'm talking minimal minimal, like maybe only one or two different screens? Like I want maybe a profiel page and then the main page that shows all your enteries and you can sort etc, this is a rough draft so we can buff it up later. I'm thinking super sleek and minimal animations, I want the ability to have pictures added in with diary entry's I want like memory stuff like 1 year ago today stuff like that.

There should be light/dark mode, differnt themese etc.
